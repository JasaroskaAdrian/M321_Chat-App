# M321_Chat-App
## Description
 This is a Chat-App which i implemented with the help of Node and other certain tools mentioned later on in this README. Firstly i wanted to implement this Application with NextJS, but i choose to do this with Node but give it a little Twist, something i havent tried before => Socket.io I want to try it since i'm interessted in Live Apps and besides i haven't gained enough experience to get a decent grade.

## Technologies
Node.js
JavaScript
Tailwind
Socket.io
HTML
MariaDB
